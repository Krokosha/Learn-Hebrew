# LearnHebrew
This is application for people who don’t know Hebrew ABC and learn the language. It has 2 parts:

The 1st part is for people who don’t know ABC. In it we can open this application, we go to HEBREW ABC, we can see all the letters, then we choose and touch any letter. And it becomes bigger and you can hear it. Then we swipe it away. And you see the next letter. At the end we can check ourselves. After that (like a bonus) we can hear a HEBREW ABC song.

The 2nd is for people who want to have their own dictionary with Hebrew words. In it we add words in our dictionary in HEBREW, add transcription and translation by ourselves. Later you’ll be able to check your words. (This part is being developed)
